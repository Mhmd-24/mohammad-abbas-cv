                <hr>
                <p>Motivated and versatile professional with a strong background in web development, teaching, and supply chain management.
                Currently a Foundations of Computer Science (FCS) student at SE Factory, where Iâ€™m deepening my understanding of core
                programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals. With hands-on experience in
                WordPress web development, I specialize in building and maintaining responsive, user-friendly websites, debugging
                themes, and customizing frontend and backend components using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Additionally, I bring a
                solid foundation in teaching math and physics, as well as experience in supply chain operations, making me a
                well-rounded candidate capable of adapting to dynamic environments and solving problems with efficiency and creativity.</p>
